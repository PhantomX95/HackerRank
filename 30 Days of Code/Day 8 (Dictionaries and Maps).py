# Task
# Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers.
# You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each name queried,
# print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber;
# if an entry for name is not found, print Not found instead.

# Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of entries in the phone book.
# Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line.
# The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.

# After the n lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries.
# Each line (query) contains a name to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

# Note: Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.

# Constraints
# 1 <= n <= 10 power 5
# 1 <= queries <= 10 power 5

# Output Format

# On a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book;
# otherwise, print the full name and phoneNumber in the format name=phoneNumber.

# Sample Input

# 3
# sam 99912222
# tom 11122222
# harry 12299933
# sam
# edward
# harry
# Sample Output

# sam=99912222
# Not found
# harry=12299933

# Solution:
PhoneBook = {}

    name, phone = input().split()
    PhoneBook[name] = phone
