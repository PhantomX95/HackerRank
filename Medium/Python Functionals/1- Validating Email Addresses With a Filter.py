# You are given an integer N followed by M email addresses.
# Your task is to print a list containing only valid email addresses in lexicographical order.

# Valid email addresses must follow these rules:
#   * It must have the username@websitename.extension format type.
#   * The username can only contain letters, digits, dashes and underscores [a-z], [A-Z], [_-].
#   * The website name can only have letters and digits [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9].
#   * The extension can only contain letters [a-z], [A-Z].
#   * The maximum length of the extension is 3.

# Concept
# A filter takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence,
# returning a list of only those members of the sequence where the function returned True.
# A Lambda function can be used with filters.

# Let's say you have to make a list of the squares of integers from 0 to 9 (both included).

# >> l = list(range(10))
# >> l = list(map(lambda x:x*x, l))

# Now, you only require those elements that are greater than  but less than .
# >> l = list(filter(lambda x: x > 10 and x < 80, l))

# Easy, isn't it?

# Example
# Complete the function fun in the editor below.
# fun has the following paramters:
#   * string s: the string to test
# Returns
#   * boolean: whether the string is a valid email or not

# Input Format
# The first line of input is the integer N, the number of email addresses.
# N lines follow, each containing a string.

# Constraints
# Each line is a non-empty string.

# Sample Input
# 3
# lara@hackerrank.com
# brian-23@hackerrank.com
# britts_54@hackerrank.com

# Sample Output
# ['brian-23@hackerrank.com', 'britts_54@hackerrank.com', 'lara@hackerrank.com']

# Solution:
import re

def fun(s):
    search = re.search(r"^([A-Za-z0-9][-_]?)+@([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.([A-Za-z]{,3})$", s)
    return True if search else False

def filter_mail(emails):
    return list(filter(fun, emails))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    emails = []
    for _ in range(n):
        emails.append(input())

filtered_emails = filter_mail(emails)
filtered_emails.sort()
print(filtered_emails)
